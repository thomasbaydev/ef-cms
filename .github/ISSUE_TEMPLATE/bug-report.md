**Severity Definition:**
* Critical Defect
Blocks entire system's or module’s functionality
No workarounds available
Testing cannot proceed further without bug being fixed.

* High-severity Defect
Affects key functionality of an application
There's a workaround, but not obvious or easy
App behaves in a way that is strongly different from the one stated in the requirements

* Medium-severity Defect
A minor function does not behave in a way stated in the requirements.
Workaround is available and easy

* Low-severity Defect
Mostly related to an application’s UI
Doesn't need a workaround, because it doesn't impact functionality
